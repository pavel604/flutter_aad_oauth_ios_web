# Flutter Azure AD for iOS and WEB

This library is a merger of flutter_aad_oauth and aad_oauth plugins on pub.dev. 
It's been refactored to exclude additional depenedencies and is using only what comes with Flutter. 
This library works with iOS and WEB platforms only, and it does not require BuildContext to work.
